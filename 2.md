To upload files to a GitHub repository using API integration, you can use the GitHub REST API. Below, I’ll provide a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this in PHP, including the required API calls and a sample code snippet.

### Steps to Upload a File to GitHub Repository

1. **Get a Personal Access Token**:
   - You need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub. This will allow your application to authenticate and interact with the API. Go to your GitHub settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens to create one. Make sure to grant the token appropriate scopes, such as `repo`, if you're accessing private repositories.

2. **Prepare Your File**:
   - Ensure you have the file you want to upload ready for the upload process.

3. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - Before uploading it, you need to base64 encode the file content.

4. **Make the API Request**:
   - Use the GitHub API to create or update a file in a repository. The endpoint for this is: `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}`.

### PHP Code Example

Here’s an example of how to upload a file using PHP and the GitHub API:

```php
<?php

function uploadFileToGitHub($filePath, $repoOwner, $repoName, $fileName, $token) {
    // Read the file contents
    $fileContent = file_get_contents($filePath);
    if ($fileContent === FALSE) {
        die("Could not read file: $filePath");
    }
    
    // Base64 encode the file content
    $base64Content = base64_encode($fileContent);

    // Prepare the API URL
    $url = "https://api.github.com/repos/$repoOwner/$repoName/contents/$fileName";

    // Prepare the data for the API request
    $data = [
        'message' => 'Adding ' . $fileName,
        'content' => $base64Content
    ];

    // Initialize cURL
    $ch = curl_init($url);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, 'PUT');
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
        "Authorization: token $token",
        'Content-Type: application/json',
        'User-Agent: PHP-Script'
    ]);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($data));

    // Execute the API request
    $response = curl_exec($ch);
    $httpCode = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);
    
    // Close the cURL session
    curl_close($ch);

    // Check the response
    if ($httpCode == 201) {
        echo "File uploaded successfully: " . json_decode($response)->content->html_url;
    } else {
        echo "Error uploading file: " . $response;
    }
}

// Example Usage
$token = 'YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN';
$repoOwner = 'your-username';
$repoName = 'your-repo-name';
$filePath = 'path/to/your/file.txt'; // Local file path
$fileName = 'file.txt'; // The name under which the file will be saved in the repo

uploadFileToGitHub($filePath, $repoOwner, $repoName, $fileName, $token);
?>
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **File Reading**: The script reads the contents of a specified file and encodes it in base64 format.
- **API URL**: It constructs the endpoint URL needed to upload the file, specifying the repository owner, repo name, and the desired path/filename within the repo.
- **cURL Setup**: Using cURL, it sets up the request method as `PUT`, specifies headers including authentication, and sends the JSON-encoded data.
- **Response Handling**: After executing the request, it checks the HTTP status code. A 201 status code indicates success, and it prints the URL of the uploaded file.

### Important Notes:
- Ensure that the GitHub repository exists before running the script.
- If the file already exists, the API will return an error; you'll need to handle such cases by either updating the existing file or deleting it first.
- Replace placeholders with your actual token, repository owner, and repository name before executing the script.

This approach provides a streamlined way to interact with the GitHub API to upload files programmatically [citation:9][citation:5].
