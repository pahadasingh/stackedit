## "State of HTML 2024": Content

### Key Points:

1. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Load resources like images or iframes only when they are required, improving page performance.
   - Example usage: `<img src="picture.jpg" loading="lazy" />`

2. **`srcset` and `sizes` Attributes**:
   - These attributes allow browsers to choose the most appropriate image source based on device resolution and viewport size.
   - Example: 
     ```html
     <img srcset="fairy-med.jpg 480w, fairy-large.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px, 800px" src="fairy-large.jpg" alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />
     ```

3. **Resource Hints**:
   - Use `<link>` tags to preload resources, which can improve loading performance.
   - Example usage: 
     ```html
     <link rel="preload" href="picture.jpg" />
     <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/" />
     <link rel="pre* | dns-prefetch | modulepreload">
     ```

4. **Content-Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - A security measure to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by defining approved sources of content.
   - Example HTTP header: `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

5. **`fetchpriority` Attribute**:
   - Suggests to the browser which resources should be fetched first to optimize loading.
   - Example: `<img src="logo.svg" fetchpriority="high" />`

6. **Blocking Rendering**:
   - Control whether certain resources block rendering until they are fully loaded.
   - Example: `<script blocking="render" async src="async-script.js"></script>`

7. **`<model>` Element for 3D Content**:
   - Embeds 3D graphical content directly into HTML for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences.
   - Example: `<model src="3d-assets/car"></model>`

8. **`controlslist` Attribute**:
   - Allows specifying controls to be hidden in media elements like videos.
   - Example: `<video src="fun.mp4" controlslist="nodownload"></video>`

9. **CSS Custom Highlight API**:
   - Enables styling arbitrary text ranges within a document using JavaScript and CSS.
   - Example: Use CSS to style specific highlighted text.
```
// css
::highlight(my-custom-highlight) {
  background-color: blue;
}

// js
const parentNode = document.getElementById("foo");
const range1 = new Range();
range1.setStart(parentNode, 10);
range1.setEnd(parentNode, 20);
const highlight = new Highlight(range1);
CSS.highlights.set("my-custom-highlight", highlight);
```

10. **`setHTMLUnsafe()` & `parseHTMLUnsafe()`**:
    - These functions are used for manipulating and parsing HTML from strings into DOM elements.
    - Example: 
      ```javascript
      const value = "<p>This is a string of text</p>";
      document.getElementById("target").setHTMLUnsafe(value);
      Document.parseHTMLUnsafe(input)
      ```

11. **`Intl.Segmenter` API**:
    - Provides language-sensitive segmentation of text into graphemes, words, or sentences, enhancing internationalization efforts.

12. **Content Management Pain Points**:
    - Issues related to embedding multimedia, machine-readable data, internationalization, localization, security, privacy, and performance that developers face when managing HTML content.

##### Lazy loading is a technique that improves page performance by delaying the loading of non-essential resources (such as images, videos, or iframes) until they are needed, typically when they come into the user's viewport during scrolling. Here are the key ways in which lazy loading enhances performance:

### Key Benefits of Lazy Loading:

1. **Reduced Initial Load Time**:
   - By loading only the essential resources at the initial page load, lazy loading decreases the amount of data that needs to be fetched right away. This leads to a faster initial rendering of the page, allowing users to begin interacting with content sooner.

2. **Lower Bandwidth Usage**:
   - Users only download content that they actively view. This is particularly beneficial for those on metered or slower internet connections, as it conserves bandwidth and reduces costs.

3. **Improved Perceived Performance**:
   - Users perceive a site as faster when they can see and interact with content more quickly. By loading images or videos only when they are about to be displayed, the page feels responsive, keeping users engaged.

4. **Reduced Memory Usage**:
   - By not loading offscreen images or resources, lazy loading minimizes memory consumption within the browser, making it easier for devices with limited resources to render the page without lag.

5. **SEO Benefits**:
   - When properly implemented, lazy loading can still be compatible with SEO practices. Search engines can index images that are lazy loaded, especially when users scroll down and trigger the loading, providing a more complete view of the content.

6. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Lazy loading contributes to a smoother scrolling experience, as it prevents the browser from trying to load too many resources all at once, which can lead to stutter and delays in rendering.

### Implementation Example
Lazy loading can be implemented using the `loading` attribute in HTML. For example:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Description of image">
```
In this case, the browser will only load the image when it is about to enter the viewport, optimizing loading behavior.

### Conclusion
Overall, lazy loading significantly optimizes web performance by smartly managing resource loading, which leads to faster load times, efficient bandwidth usage, and an enhanced user experience. This technique is especially crucial for content-rich websites that include many images or videos.
